The task was to create a story-based game using only javascript. The game I chose was one that simulated the build-up and first week of starting at Sparta Global.

### Languages used
* Javascript
* HTML

### How to download

### Challenges
1. Making sure all typos were eliminated
2. Formatting an if statement correctly, I orignially had each if statement branch its own game, leading to a lot of lines of code
3. Trying to understand the logic and learn about each statement applied a lot of time constraints

### Learning points
1. A greater understanding of Javascript, specifically if statements
2. Proper structure of a plan helps a lot
